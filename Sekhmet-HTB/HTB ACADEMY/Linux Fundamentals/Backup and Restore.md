When backing up data on an Ubuntu system, we can utilize tools such as:

- Rsync
- Deja Dup
- Duplicity

Rsync, Duplicity, and Deja Dup are tools for backing up data on Ubuntu systems. Rsync is an open-source tool that efficiently backs up files by only transmitting changed parts. Duplicity, a graphical backup tool, uses Rsync and adds encryption and remote storage options. Deja Dup simplifies backups with a user-friendly interface, also using Rsync and supporting encryption. To protect backups, encrypting data with tools like GnuPG, eCryptfs, and LUKS is recommended. These tools help ensure secure and easily restorable backups.

Rsync to save a specific directory 

```shell-session
SekhmetCyka@htb[/htb]$ rsync -av /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

This command will copy the entire directory (`/path/to/mydirectory`) to a remote host (`backup_server`), to the directory `/path/to/backup/directory`. The option `archive` (`-a`) is used to preserve the original file attributes, such as permissions, timestamps, etc., and using the `verbose` (`-v`) option provides a detailed output of the progress of the `rsync` operation.

We can also add additional options to customize the backup process, such as using compression and incremental backups. We can do this like the following:

```shell-session
SekhmetCyka@htb[/htb]$ rsync -avz --backup --backup-dir=/path/to/backup/folder --delete /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

With this, we back up the `mydirectory` to the remote `backup_server`, preserving the original file attributes, timestamps, and permissions, and enabled compression (`-z`) for faster transfers. The `--backup` option creates incremental backups in the directory `/path/to/backup/folder`, and the `--delete` option removes files from the remote host that is no longer present in the source directory.

If we want to restore our directory from our backup server to our local directory, we can use the following command:

#### Rsync - Restore our Backup

Backup and Restore

```shell-session
SekhmetCyka@htb[/htb]$ rsync -av user@remote_host:/path/to/backup/directory /path/to/mydirectory
```

## Encrypted Rsync

To ensure the security of our `rsync` file transfer between our local host and our backup server, we can combine the use of SSH and other security measures. By using SSH, we are able to encrypt our data as it is being transferred, making it much more difficult for any unauthorized individual to access it. Additionally, we can also use firewalls and other security protocols to ensure that our data is kept safe and secure during the transfer. By taking these steps, we can be confident that our data is protected and our file transfer is secure. Therefore we tell `rsync` to use SSH like the following:

#### Secure Transfer of our Backup

Backup and Restore

```shell-session
SekhmetCyka@htb[/htb]$ rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

The data transfer between our local host and the backup server occurs over the encrypted SSH connection, which provides confidentiality and integrity protection for the data being transferred. This encryption process ensures that the data is protected from any potential malicious actors who would otherwise be able to access and modify the data without authorization. The encryption key itself is also safeguarded by a comprehensive set of security protocols, making it even more difficult for any unauthorized person to gain access to the data. In addition, the encrypted connection is designed to be highly resistant to any attempts to breach security, allowing us to have confidence in the protection of the data being transferred.

## Auto-Synchronization

To enable auto-synchronization using `rsync`, you can use a combination of `cron` and `rsync` to automate the synchronization process. Scheduling the cron job to run at regular intervals ensures that the contents of the two systems are kept in sync. This can be especially beneficial for organizations that need to keep their data synchronized across multiple machines. Furthermore, setting up auto-synchronization with `rsync` can be a great way to save time and effort, as it eliminates the need for manual synchronization. It also helps to ensure that the files and data stored in the systems are kept up-to-date and consistent, which helps to reduce errors and improve efficiency.

Therefore we create a new script called `RSYNC_Backup.sh`, which will trigger the `rsync` command to sync our local directory with the remote one.

#### RSYNC_Backup.sh

Code: bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/mydirectory user@backup_server:/path/to/backup/directory
```

Then, in order to ensure that the script is able to execute properly, we must provide the necessary permissions. Additionally, it's also important to make sure that the script is owned by the correct user, as this will ensure that only the correct user has access to the script and that the script is not tampered with by any other user.

Backup and Restore

```shell-session
SekhmetCyka@htb[/htb]$ chmod +x RSYNC_Backup.sh
```

After that, we can create a crontab that tells `cron` to run the script every hour at the 0th minute. We can adjust the timing to suit our needs. To do so, the crontab needs the following content:

#### Auto-Sync - Crontab

Backup and Restore

```shell-session
0 * * * * /path/to/RSYNC_Backup.sh
```

With this setup, `cron` will be responsible for executing the script at the desired interval, ensuring that the `rsync` command is run and the contents of the local directory are synchronized with the remote host.
