Response codes are used to determine the request's status, as will be discussed in a later section. After the first line, the response lists its headers, similar to an HTTP request. Both request and response headers are discussed in the next section.

Finally, the response may end with a response body, which is separated by a new line after the headers. The response body is usually defined as `HTML` code. However, it can also respond with other code types such as `JSON`, website resources such as images, style sheets or scripts, or even a document such as a PDF document hosted on the webserver.
