|`User`|The [user](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/security/s1/sec-s1-cr-book/sec-cr-t2.html#wp2992613898) password is used for logging in to Cisco IOS. It is used to restrict access to the network device and its features.|
|`Enable Password`|The [enable password](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/security/d1/sec-d1-cr-book/sec-cr-e1.html#wp3884449514) is used to enter "enable" mode. The "enable" mode is the mode where you have access to advanced functions and settings.|
|`Secret`|The [secret](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/security/s1/sec-s1-cr-book/sec-cr-s1.html#wp2622423174) is a password to secure access to certain functions and services. It is often used to restrict access to remote management tools and services.|

We highly recommend going through the provided external resources to understand the encryption mechanics of Cisco IOS and how those are used.

The Cisco IOS devices can be configured for SSH or Telnet. So it can be accessed remotely. We can determine from the response we receive that it is indeed a Cisco IOS, as it responds with the `User Access Verification` message.
