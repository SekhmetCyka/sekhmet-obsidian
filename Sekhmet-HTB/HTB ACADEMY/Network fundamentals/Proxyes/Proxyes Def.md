### Different Perspectives on Proxies:
- **Security Professionals**: Think of HTTP Proxies (e.g., BurpSuite) or SOCKS/SSH Proxies (e.g., Chisel, ptunnel, sshuttle) for pivoting.
- **Web Developers**: Use proxies like Cloudflare or ModSecurity to block malicious traffic.
- **Average People**: Often believe proxies obfuscate location to access content like another country's Netflix catalog.
- **Law Enforcement**: Often associate proxies with illegal activity.

### Definition of a Proxy:
- A proxy is a device or service that mediates a connection, able to inspect the contents of the traffic.
- Without the ability to inspect traffic, a device is technically a gateway, not a proxy.

### Common Misconception:
- Average people often confuse proxies with VPNs used for location obfuscation.
- Misunderstanding is harmless and not worth correcting to avoid extended, unrelated discussions.

### Key Types of Proxy Services:
- **Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy**: Serves client requests by forwarding them to the internet.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Serves incoming requests to a server by forwarding them to appropriate backend servers.
- **Transparent Proxy**: Intercepts client requests without any client configuration.
