2. **Functionality**:
   - Provides secure and confidential access to network resources and services.
   - Allows administrators to manage internal servers remotely.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Companies often restrict server access to local networks.
   - VPNs allow remote access by creating encrypted tunnels via internet connections.

4. **Security**:
   - VPNs encrypt data transfer, protecting against interception and data theft.

5. **IP Assignment**:
   - Remote devices are assigned local IP addresses to access internal servers.

6. **Common Usage**:
   - VPNs are used for secure, cost-effective remote access to company networks.
   - Employees can access resources like email and file servers remotely.

7. **Connection Protocols**:

| **Requirement**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VPN Client`     | This is installed on the remote device and is used to establish and maintain a VPN connection with the VPN server. For example, this could be an OpenVPN client.        |
| `VPN Server`     | This is a computer or network device responsible for accepting VPN connections from VPN clients and routing traffic between the VPN clients and the private network.    |
| `Encryption`     | VPN connections are encrypted using a variety of encryption algorithms and protocols, such as AES and IPsec, to secure the connection and protect the transmitted data. |
| `Authentication` | The VPN server and client must authenticate each other using a shared secret, certificate, or another authentication method to establish a secure connection.           |

**Summary Points:**

1. **Definition and Purpose**:
   - Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a network security protocol providing encryption and authentication for internet communications.

2. **Functionality**:
   - Encrypts the data payload of each IP packet.
   - Adds an authentication header (AH) to verify packet integrity and authenticity.

3. **Key Protocols**:
   - **Authentication Header (AH)**:
     - Provides integrity and authenticity for IP packets without encryption.
     - Adds an authentication header containing a cryptographic checksum to verify packet integrity.
   - **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)**:
     - Provides encryption and optional authentication for IP packets.
     - Encrypts the data payload and optionally adds an authentication header.

| **Mode**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `Transport Mode` | In this mode, IPsec encrypts and authenticates the data payload of each IP packet but does not encrypt the IP header. This is typically used to secure end-to-end communication between two hosts. |
| `Tunnel Mode`    | With this mode, IPsec encrypts and authenticates the entire IP packet, including the IP header. This is typically used to create a VPN tunnel between two networks.                                |
For example, an administrator could place a firewall in between. In order to facilitate IPsec VPN traffic from a VPN client outside a firewall to a VPN server inside, the firewall would need to allow the following protocols:

| **Protocol**                             | **Port**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `Internet Protocol` (`IP`)               | `UDP/50-51` | This is the primary protocol that provides the foundation for all internet communication. It is used to route packets of data between the VPN client and the VPN server.                                                                                                                                 |
| `Internet Key Exchange` (`IKE`)          | `UDP/500`   | IKE is a protocol that is used to establish and maintain secure communication between the VPN client and the VPN server. It is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, and it is used to negotiate and establish shared secret keys that can be used to encrypt and decrypt the VPN traffic. |
| `Encapsulating Security Payload` (`ESP`) | `UDP/4500`  | ESP is also a protocol that provides encryption and authentication for IP datagrams. It is used to encrypt the VPN traffic between the VPN client and the VPN server, using the keys that were negotiated with IKE.                                                                                      |
**Summary Points:**

1. **Definition and Purpose**:
   - Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a network protocol used to create VPNs by establishing a secure tunnel between the VPN client and server.

2. **Functionality**:
   - Encapsulates data transmitted within the tunnel.
   - Originally an extension of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).

3. **Compatibility**:
   - Supported by many operating systems.

4. **Security Concerns**:
   - Known vulnerabilities make PPTP no longer considered secure.
   - Uses MSCHAPv2 for authentication, employing outdated DES encryption, easily crackable with specialized hardware.

5. **Protocol Support**:
   - Can tunnel protocols such as IP, IPX, or NetBEUI via IP.

6. **Current Status**:
   - Largely replaced by more secure VPN protocols like L2TP/IPsec, IPsec/IKEv2, and OpenVPN.
   - Use of PPTP has declined since 2012 due to security weaknesses.
