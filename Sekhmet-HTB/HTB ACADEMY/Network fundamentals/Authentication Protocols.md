| `CHAP`       | An authentication protocol that uses a three-way handshake to verify a user's identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `EAP`        | A framework for supporting multiple authentication methods, allowing for the use of various technologies to verify a user's identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `SSH`        | This is a network protocol for secure communication between a client and a server. We can use it for remote command-line access and remote command execution, as well as for secure file transfer. SSH uses encryption to protect against eavesdropping and other attacks and can also be used for authentication.                                                                                                                                  |
| `HTTPS`      | This is a secure version of the HTTP protocol used for communication on the internet. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt communication and provide authentication, ensuring that third parties cannot intercept and read the transmitted data. It is widely used for secure communication over the internet, particularly for web browsing.                                                                                                              |
| `LEAP`       | LEAP is a wireless authentication protocol developed by Cisco. It uses EAP to provide mutual authentication between a wireless client and a server and uses the RC4 encryption algorithm to encrypt communication between the two. Unfortunately, LEAP is vulnerable to dictionary attacks and other security vulnerabilities and has been largely replaced by more secure protocols such as EAP-TLS and PEAP.                                      |
| `PEAP`       | PEAP on the other hand is a secure tunneling protocol used for wireless and wired networks. It is based on EAP and uses TLS to encrypt communication between a client and a server. PEAP uses a server-side certificate to authenticate the server and can also be used to authenticate the client using various methods, such as passwords, certificates, or biometric data. PEAP is widely used in enterprise networks for secure authentication. |
As physical connections, protocols with `SSL` or `TLS` are used by default, such as `SSH` or `HTTPS`. Both protocols use robust encryption algorithms to protect the authentication information transmitted between the client and the server. This helps to prevent interception or to tamper the authentication data, which is essential for maintaining the security of the authentication process. Also, they support using digital certificates and `PKI` for authenticating the server to the client. This ensures that the client can verify the server's identity and helps to prevent MITM attacks. SSH and HTTPS are widely used and well-supported protocols, with implementations available for various operating systems and devices and makes them easy to use and deploy in a variety of environments.
