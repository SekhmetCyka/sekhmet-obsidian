`TCP/IP` (`Transmission Control Protocol`/`Internet Protocol`) is a generic term for many network protocols. The protocols are responsible for the switching and transport of data packets on the Internet. The Internet is entirely based on the `TCP/IP` protocol family. However, `TCP/IP` does not only refer to these two protocols but is usually used as a generic term for an entire protocol family.

For example, `ICMP` (`Internet Control Message Protocol`) or `UDP` (`User Datagram Protocol`) belongs to the protocol family. The protocol family provides the necessary functions for transporting and switching data packets in a private or public network.

| **Layer**       | **Function**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `4.Application` | The Application Layer allows applications to access the other layers' services and defines the protocols applications use to exchange data.                                                                                                      |
| `3.Transport`   | The Transport Layer is responsible for providing (TCP) session and (UDP) datagram services for the Application Layer.                                                                                                                            |
| `2.Internet`    | The Internet Layer is responsible for host addressing, packaging, and routing functions.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `1.Link`        | The Link layer is responsible for placing the TCP/IP packets on the network medium and receiving corresponding packets from the network medium. TCP/IP is designed to work independently of the network access method, frame format, and medium. |


The most important tasks of `TCP/IP` are:

| **Task**               | **Protocol** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `Logical Addressing`   | `IP`         | Due to many hosts in different networks, there is a need to structure the network topology and logical addressing. Within TCP/IP, IP takes over the logical addressing of networks and nodes. Data packets only reach the network where they are supposed to be. The methods to do so are `network classes`, `subnetting`, and `CIDR`. |
| `Routing`              | `IP`         | For each data packet, the next node is determined in each node on the way from the sender to the receiver. This way, a data packet is routed to its receiver, even if its location is unknown to the sender.                                                                                                                           |
| `Error & Control Flow` | `TCP`        | The sender and receiver are frequently in touch with each other via a virtual connection. Therefore control messages are sent continuously to check if the connection is still established.                                                                                                                                            |
| `Application Support`  | `TCP`        | TCP and UDP ports form a software abstraction to distinguish specific applications and their communication links.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Name Resolution`      | `DNS`        | DNS provides name resolution through Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) in IP addresses, enabling us to reach the desired host with the specified name on the internet.                                                                                                                                                               |
