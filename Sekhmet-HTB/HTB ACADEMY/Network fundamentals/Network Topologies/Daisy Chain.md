**Daisy Chain

- **Daisy Chain Topology**:
  - Multiple hosts are connected by placing a cable from one node to another, forming a chain of connections.
  - Also known as a daisy-chain configuration.

- **Usage**:
  - Commonly found in automation technology (e.g., Controller Area Network, CAN).

- **Characteristics**:
  - Based on the physical arrangement of the nodes.
  - Unlike token procedures, which are structural and independent of physical layout.
  - Signals are sent to and from components via preceding nodes to the computer system.
