**Ring

- **Physical Ring Topology**:
  - Each host is connected to the ring with two cables: one for incoming signals and one for outgoing signals.
  - One cable arrives at and one cable leaves each host.
  - Typically does not require an active network component.
  - Control and access to the transmission medium are regulated by a protocol.

- **Logical Ring Topology**:
  - Based on a physical star topology.
  - A central distributor simulates the ring by forwarding data from one port to the next.

- **Transmission**:
  - Information is transmitted in a predetermined direction.
  - Sequential access to the transmission medium from station to station.
  - Access can be controlled by a central station or a token, which is a bit pattern passing through the network in one direction.
