A network topology refers to the arrangement and physical or logical connection of devices within a network. Hosts, such as clients and servers, use the network actively, while components like switches, bridges, and routers manage the distribution and logical connections among hosts. The topology determines the necessary components and access methods for the transmission media.

The physical topology describes the layout of the transmission medium, including cabling plans, node positions, and connections. In contrast, the logical topology defines how signals behave on the network media and how data is transmitted across the network, regardless of the physical connections.

| `Wired connections`  | `Wireless connections` |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Coaxial cabling      | Wi-Fi                  |
| Glass fiber cabling  | Cellular               |
| Twisted-pair cabling | Satellite              |
| and others           | and others             |

| Repeaters    | Hubs     | Bridges   | Switches |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Router/Modem | Gateways | Firewalls |          |

We can imagine a topology as a virtual form or `structure of a network`. This form does not necessarily correspond to the actual physical arrangement of the devices in the network. Therefore these topologies can be either `physical` or `logical`. For example, the computers on a `LAN` may be arranged in a circle in a bedroom, but it is very unlikely to have an actual ring topology.

Network topologies are divided into the following eight basic types:

| Point-to-Point | Bus         |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Star           | Ring        |
| Mesh           | Tree        |
| Hybrid         | Daisy Chain |

More complex networks can be built as hybrids of two or more of the basic topologies mentioned above.
