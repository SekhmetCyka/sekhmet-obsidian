**Mesh

- **Meshed Networks**:
  - Nodes decide on connections at the physical level and routing at the logical level.
  - No fixed topology; two basic structures: fully meshed and partially meshed.

- **Fully Meshed Structure**:
  - Each host is connected to every other host.
  - Ensures high reliability and bandwidth.
  - Common in WAN or MAN setups.
  - Important nodes like routers are interconnected.
  - Resilient to router failures, as other routers can maintain network functionality.
  - Each node has the same routing functions and knows neighboring nodes and traffic loads.

- **Partially Meshed Structure**:
  - Endpoints are connected by only one connection.
  - Some nodes connect to exactly one other node.
  - Other nodes may connect to two or more nodes via point-to-point connections.
