### Common Protocols

- **Definition**:
  - Internet protocols are standardized rules defined in RFCs for device communication on a network.
  - Ensure consistent and reliable information exchange, independent of hardware and software.

- **Connection Types**:
  - **Wired or Wireless**: Devices need a communication channel to exchange information.
  - **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: Connection-oriented protocol.
  - **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: Connectionless protocol.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
  - **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes a virtual connection using a Three-Way-Handshake before data transmission.
  - **Data Transfer**: Maintains connection until data transfer is complete.
  - **Example**: When entering a URL, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server via TCP. The server responds with HTML code, rendered by the browser.
  - **Characteristics**: Reliable but slower due to overhead for establishing and maintaining connections.

- **Importance**:
  - Understanding common protocols is crucial for effective network communication and troubleshooting.
  - Protocols are the foundation of communication between devices and computers in networks.
